# Student-Course-Catalog
Course Catalog that stores and accesses student information using SQL DB, students may also enroll in courses
StudentManage.py is run first. This is file creates a gui using tkinter which takes user input for student.
This student information is stored in a student management database.
Information can be deleted, edited, added at any time.
Student information from the DB is used as authentication to access course catalog and add courses. 
Currently working on Course Catalog GUI and DB as well as a more robust enrollment cart system to facilitate prequisites,concurrent,degree planning, etc.
